# Binary_Tree-Operations
C Program For Operations In Binary Tree

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.

The main operations in binary tree are: Search, Insert & Delete. We will see the worst case time complexity of these operations in binary trees. In a binary tree, a node can have maximum two children.

This Is A C Program To Illustrate The Operations Done In A Binary Tree

The Operations Illustrated :

	1. Insert In Binary Tree
	
	2. Delete From Binary Tree
	
	3. Inorder Traversal Of Binary Tree
	
	4. Postorder Traversal Of Binary Tree
	
	5. Preorder Traversal Of Binary Tree
	
	6. Search & replace
	
	7. Exit
	
The User Will Be Prompted To :
	
	1. Enter Choice
	
	2. Enter New Element
	
	3. Enter The Element To Be Deleted
	
	4. Enter The Element To Be Searched
	
	5. Replace The Element
	
The Errors Prompted To The User :

	1. Invalid Choice - Try Again
	
	2. Node Not Found
	
	3. Element Does Not Exist In The Binary Tree

The GCC File Also Have Been Pushed.
